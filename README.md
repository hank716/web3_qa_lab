This project is a career-oriented learning and practice record for Web3 test engineers, covering five major stages:

1. Blockchain node testing (chainwatcher)

2. Smart contract testing (contract-tester, to be built)

3. DApp test integration (web3-voting-dapp, to be built)

4. Automated testing framework and CI/CD (chainwatcher-tests, to be built)

5. Blockchain data verification tool (block-audit-tool, to be built)
